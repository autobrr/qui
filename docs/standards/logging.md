# Logging standards

DEBUG is the default log level (`internal/config/config.go`). Thus, each DEBUG line goes into the first log that a user sends with a report.

- If a line fires once for each HTTP request, timer tick, torrent, or loop pass, put it at TRACE. If its content never changes, delete it.
- Each background loop keeps one summary line at DEBUG.
- Keep these at DEBUG: retry paths, failure paths, loop summaries, and proxy mutations (rename, delete, setLocation, reannounce).
- Do not log at Error inside a loop over torrents. Count the failures, and write one line after the loop. No log level can suppress an Error line, so one bad input can write thousands of lines.
